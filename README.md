# org2xm
Clownacy and BLink's Fork of pachuco's fork of Rrola's organya to fasttracker converter

To convert, just drag and drop your org onto org2xm (defaults to use ORG210EN.DAT as the soundbank)

To use a different soundbank, you have to use the cli and provide the soundbank as the second argument.

The following command would convert example.org in the current directory to example.xm using the Japanese 2.10 release of ORGmaker's soundbank.

** $ org2xm example.org ORGJP210.DAT **
